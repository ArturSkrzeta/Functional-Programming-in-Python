										<h2>Functional Programming in Python</h2>

										<h3>Intro</h3>
										<p>Programming languages follow one of 2 paradigms:</p>

										<table>
											<thead>
												<tr>
													<th>Imperative</th>
													<th>Declarative</th>
												</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
												<tr>
													<td>Supports procedural paradigm.</td>
													<td>Supports functional paradigm.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>We list all the step-by-step instructions that tell the computer what to do with the program’s input.</td>
													<td>We write what we want and the implemented lanugage figures out how to perform the computation efficiently </td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>C, PHP, all major languages.</td>
													<td>SQL, markup languages, CSS.</td>
												</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>

										<p>There are also two different ways of approaching problems in programming:</p>

										<table>
											<thead>
												<tr>
													<th>Object-oriented Programming</th>
													<th>Functional Programming</th>
												</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
												<tr>
													<td>Program manipulates collections of objects.</td>
													<td>Program decomposes a problem into a set of functions.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Objects have internal state (attributes fed with data) that can be modified by object's methods.</td>
													<td>Functions accept inputs and produce outputs without any state that may affect a returned object.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Programs consist of making the right set of state changes.</td>
													<td>Programs avoid state changes as much as possible and works with data flowing between functions.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Java is object-oriented lanugage. C++ and Python support object-oriented programming, but don’t force the use it.</td>
													<td>Haksell, Scala.</td>
												</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>

										<h5>How it goes in Python:</h5>
										<ul>
											<li>Python is multi-paradigm based.</li>
											<li>We can write large procedural prgrams that executes code line by line from top to bottom.
													We can rely on object-oriented approach defining our own types or importing types from external libraries.
													We can either apply functional pragramming to put data intake throigh set of functions.
											</li>
											<li>In large programs, different parts can be defined using different approaches like UI can be object-oriented while the whole logic is procedural or functinal way.</li>
											<li>Functional style supports functions with no side effects that could modify internal state or make other changes (like print(), time.sleep()) that aren’t visible in the function’s return value.
													We define such functions as <b>purely functional</b> so they don't use any data structures that get updated as a program runs and the final returned output depens on an input solely.
											</li>
											<li>Python provides a functional-appearing interface but will use non-functional features under the hood.
													For example, the implementation of a function will still use assignments to local variables, however it won't affect any global variables.
													Interestingly, this is in oposizton to a strictly functional languages which don't even have any assignment statements such as <code>a = 3</code> or <code>c = a + b</code>.
													Another example is every functions that take and return instances representing objects.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<h5>Why to use Functional Programming:</h5>
										<ul>
											<li>Easiness of mathematical proof that a functional program is correct as functional prgramming is the closest to math possible style.
													However, mathematical proof doesn't mean unit testing where we give inputs and compare it with expected output.
													Can be used therotically, however in case of Python's program it's usually not in usage.
											</li>
											<li>Modularity - this is a very practical rule of keepeing your code and thus breaking the problem apart into small pieces.
													Small functions with single responsibility is easier to read, debug, test and update.
													Each function is a unit for a test.
											</li>
											<li>Reusability - all the small functions can act like sub-programs that can be used in different part of main program many times.
												 	We are able then to literally assemble new programs by arranging existing functions in a new configuration and writing a few functions specialized for the current task as needed.
